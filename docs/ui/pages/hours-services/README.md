# Horaires & services

Status: Current design package for an existing integrated route

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA product and engineering

Prompt snapshot topology: GENERATED_SNAPSHOTS

Prompt provenance: prompt-provenance.json

Last updated: 2026-08-08

Route: `/etablissement/horaires-services`

Application: `apps/backoffice`

## Current status

This route already exists and is integrated.

It:

- runs inside the authenticated Backoffice shell;
- uses trusted booking tenant context;
- requires `booking.settings.manage`;
- loads establishment-scoped booking administration data from `@yuta/db-cloud`;
- uses establishment locale and timezone;
- displays and edits weekly service periods;
- reads weekly service periods for today and public-preview summaries;
- displays persisted service summaries and upcoming exceptions;
- supports current exception mutations;
- creates and deletes weekly service periods through the current booking
  administration actions;
- uses `@yuta/ui`, semantic tokens, and `lucide-react`.

Global booking rules are managed on the separate integrated route
`/reservations/parametres`.

This package guides visual and interaction improvements. It must not replace the route with fixture data or discard current authorization and persistence.
