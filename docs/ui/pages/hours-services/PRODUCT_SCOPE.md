# Horaires & services — Product Scope

Status: Current

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA product and engineering

## User goal

An authorized restaurant manager configures weekly service schedules and
manages booking exceptions on this route.

## Current approved capabilities

The existing route currently supports the established booking administration model:

### Weekly service periods

This route reads, creates, and deletes the current Booking-owned weekly service
periods. It uses them for summaries, exception selection, and the persisted
public preview. Their editor is `/etablissement/horaires-services`; route
placement does not transfer their semantic or persistence ownership.

See the [weekly-schedule UI scope](UI_SPEC.md#weekly-schedule-ownership) and the
[General Information page responsibility](../establishment-general-information/README.md).

Current service periods contain:

- day of week;
- name;
- service start time;
- service end time;
- capacity;
- enabled state;
- sort order.

### Exceptions

Current exception kinds are:

```text
CLOSED_ALL_DAY
CLOSED_SERVICE
MODIFIED_HOURS
BLOCKED_SLOT
```

### Security and scope

- The route is establishment-scoped.
- Tenant context is derived from trusted server session state.
- The route requires `booking.settings.manage`.
- Cloud persistence remains behind server boundaries.

## Page purpose

The page may improve presentation of:

- today's operational summary;
- persisted customer-facing hours preview;
- upcoming current exception kinds;
- exception create and delete actions.

Global booking rules, including confirmation, slot, duration, notice, and
booking-window settings, are managed on
`/reservations/parametres`.

## Out of scope without separate approval

The following concepts are not current persistence requirements:

- reservation start and end windows per service;
- last-arrival time per service;
- table duration per service instead of the current global average;
- a persisted enabled or disabled record for an otherwise empty weekday;
- a distinct `OPEN_EXCEPTIONALLY` exception kind;
- copy-day merge or replace persistence semantics;
- previewing unsaved rather than persisted values;
- automatic holiday import;
- seasonal schedules;
- external profile synchronization;
- drag-and-drop scheduling;
- room or terrace-specific schedules.

## Product boundary

This page belongs to cloud booking administration.

It does not introduce customer ordering, checkout, payment, invoicing, cash management, transaction-linked loyalty, promotions, or generic email workflows.

## Proposal rule

When a requested design needs an out-of-scope capability:

1. document the user behavior;
2. map current fields and gaps;
3. propose contracts, schema, authorization, migration, and tests;
4. wait for explicit approval;
5. implement the smallest coherent extension.

Do not infer persistence from the visual reference.
