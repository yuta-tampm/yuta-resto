# Horaires & services — UI Specification

Status: Current design reference

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA product and engineering

Last updated: 2026-08-07

## Authority and scope

This document guides visual and interaction improvements for the existing route:

```text
/etablissement/horaires-services
```

The implementation, booking contracts and schema, current public-booking documentation, authorization, and tests remain behavior authority.

References:

- `references/desktop.png`
- `../../references/yuta-shell-brand-reference.png`

Do not copy navigation or unsupported modules from either image.

## Current implementation baseline

The route already:

- runs inside the authenticated Backoffice shell;
- requires trusted booking tenant context and `booking.settings.manage`;
- loads establishment-scoped booking administration data from `@yuta/db-cloud`;
- uses establishment timezone and locale;
- displays and edits weekly service periods;
- reads weekly service periods for summaries and exception choices;
- displays persisted service summaries and upcoming exceptions;
- supports current exception create/delete actions through established server
  patterns;
- uses `@yuta/ui`, semantic tokens, and `lucide-react`.

Improvements must preserve this behavior. Do not restart the route with fixture data or remove server authorization and data integration.

## Page header

Use existing Backoffice breadcrumb behavior.

Title:

```text
Horaires & services
```

Description:

```text
Consultez les services et gérez les jours exceptionnels.
```

The primary action must reflect a real current mutation.

A public-preview action is added only when its target and saved or unsaved semantics are approved.

Do not display one global `Enregistrer` action if separate current forms persist independently.

## Today summary

Show a compact summary based on current persisted data:

- today's open or closed state;
- today's active service ranges;
- the next applicable current exception.

Status includes text and does not rely on color alone.

Do not imply unsupported per-service reservation windows or last-arrival fields.

## Main sections

The primary area is:

```text
Jours exceptionnels
```

Use the current route and accessibility conventions.

Tabs, anchors, native disclosure, or another pattern must reflect actual behavior rather than visual imitation.

## Desktop layout

At wide widths:

- upcoming exceptions form the dominant column;
- supporting summaries form a narrower secondary column;
- use `minmax(0, 1fr)` for the main region;
- use approximately `20rem` for the supporting column when consistent with the current shell;
- preserve the current page container and shell spacing.

Supporting cards stack below when space is insufficient.

## Weekly schedule ownership

This route is the only Backoffice editor for the persisted seven-day service
schedule. It supports the current create and delete mutations and uses the
schedule for today's summary, exception choices, and public preview.

## Supporting summaries

### Persisted public preview

Render every weekday from its own persisted service periods.

Do not merge weekdays under one shared label unless their complete persisted schedules are actually equal and the grouping behavior is approved.

The preview must not imply unsaved changes are public.

### Upcoming exceptions

Show only current exception kinds:

```text
CLOSED_ALL_DAY
CLOSED_SERVICE
MODIFIED_HOURS
BLOCKED_SLOT
```

Do not display `Ouverture exceptionnelle` as a distinct persisted type unless the domain is extended.

## Mutation presentation

- Exception deletion requires confirmation.
- Forms expose pending, validation-error, persisted-success, save-error, and retry states.
- Exception fields follow the selected current kind.
- Irrelevant fields are not submitted.
- The current exception create/delete capabilities must remain truthful.

## Responsive behavior

Verify at:

```text
1440 px
1024 px
768 px
390 px
```

Requirements:

- no horizontal page scrolling;
- the secondary column stacks below the exception workflow;
- service data becomes a readable label/value grid or vertical list;
- primary actions remain available without clipping;
- disclosures and menus remain keyboard and touch accessible;
- dialogs use current mobile-appropriate behavior rather than an assumed Drawer component;
- the page preserves the existing shell at each breakpoint.

## Accessibility

- Disclosure triggers expose expanded state and visible focus.
- Icon-only actions have accessible names and tooltips where appropriate.
- Status badges include text.
- Form controls have labels, hints, and associated errors.
- Dialog focus is managed on open and close.
- Time fields remain keyboard accessible.
- Destructive confirmation names the affected exception.
- Pending state does not remove essential context.

## Visual acceptance

- The page clearly belongs to the current Backoffice shell.
- Existing navigation, establishment selection, and permissions remain unchanged.
- The weekly schedule and upcoming exceptions remain the primary task surfaces.
- Supporting summaries do not compete with the primary workflow.
- Existing semantic tokens and shared primitives are reused.
- No reference-image colors or navigation are copied directly.
- All seven weekdays and current exception kinds remain readable.
- Mobile and tablet layouts have no overflow.
- Current save, create, and delete behavior still works.
- Loading, errors, forbidden, success, and recovery states remain truthful.
- Screenshots exist for requested widths.
- Intentional deviations from the visual reference are recorded.

## Out of scope without separate approval

- database or contract redesign;
- new capabilities listed in `PRODUCT_SCOPE.md`;
- application-shell redesign;
- unrelated Backoffice navigation changes;
- a new UI, icon, form, or state-management library;
- complex calendar;
- drag-and-drop scheduling;
- holiday import;
- external profile synchronization.
