# Today dashboard — Acceptance checklist

## Exposure applicability

Both profiles use the current route, trusted context, existing grants and
shared UI. Booking and its dominant-column requirements below apply only to
`internal`; the A checklist follows the accepted
[Today projection](../../../features/today/README.md#accepted-release-a-projection).
Unchecked items are verification obligations, not completed evidence. Historical
internal screenshots/QA do not establish A results or customer-release readiness.

## Documentation and repository

- [ ] Root, Backoffice, current feature, and current UI documents were read.
- [ ] The package follows `docs/ui/PAGE_PACK_PROTOCOL.md`.
- [ ] `/aujourdhui` remains the only current route.
- [ ] Current documentation indexes and checks include this package.
- [ ] No parallel, versioned, migration, or completion document is added.

## Security and boundaries

- [ ] Organization and establishment scope comes from trusted server context.
- [ ] Internal Booking entitlement and `booking.read` are enforced.
- [ ] Reputation entitlement and `reputation.read` are enforced when applicable.
- [ ] `@yuta/db-cloud` remains server-side.
- [ ] One tenant cannot access another tenant's dashboard data.
- [ ] Browser input does not define trusted scope, permission, locale, or timezone.

## Product scope

- [ ] Fixture dashboard values are removed from the production route.
- [ ] Financial, payment, cash, POS, and order-flow content is absent.
- [ ] Tasks, team, generic email, and content approval are not fabricated.
- [ ] Reservation cut-off and last-arrival fields are absent.
- [ ] No unsupported navigation, mutation, schema, contract, or permission is added.

## Current data

- [ ] The date uses establishment timezone and locale.
- [ ] Internal reservations use the establishment-local date and current statuses.
- [ ] Internal reservation counters reconcile with the scoped result.
- [ ] Internal Booking services use enabled persisted periods for the local weekday.
- [ ] Reviews appear only when entitled, permitted, and supported.
- [ ] Independent section failures do not become misleading zeros.

## UI and interactions

- [ ] Existing shell and tenant selector remain unchanged.
- [ ] Supported summaries use real destinations.
- [ ] In internal, reservations remain the dominant task surface.
- [ ] Add behavior exposes only real, permission-allowed actions.
- [ ] Unsupported filter chips and empty overflow menus are absent.
- [ ] Loading, empty, hidden/forbidden, unavailable, and recovery states are truthful.
- [ ] `@yuta/ui`, semantic tokens, and `lucide-react` are reused.

## Release A projection

- [ ] No Booking/DIRECT/AI read, serialization, card, panel or CTA is exposed.
- [ ] Google source and organization/establishment/actor predicates agree across
      count, preview and linked list; STAFF remains assigned-only.
- [ ] New means `NEW`; attention uses `NEW/TO_PROCESS/DRAFTED/FOLLOW_UP` and
      counters are not capped by preview/page limits.
- [ ] A local `PUBLISHED` reply neither excludes an active local queue row nor
      claims a remote reply.
- [ ] New/attention links narrow the Google scope; forged source/detail/filter
      input cannot widen it.
- [ ] Setup/empty/unavailable states provide permitted OWNER setup or operator
      handoff without claiming import execution/success/publication.
- [ ] Header, summaries, applicable setup/recovery and Google preview remain
      readable in the A single-column composition at all approved widths.
- [ ] Actual A Browser QA is attributable separately from internal regression
      and preserves required role/context/loading/recovery/accessibility checks.

## Responsive and accessibility

- [ ] 1536, 1024, 768, and 390 px are checked.
- [ ] No horizontal page overflow occurs.
- [ ] Mobile content follows the specified priority order.
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is valid.
- [ ] Status includes text and does not rely on color.
- [ ] Focus is visible and keyboard operation works.
- [ ] Icon-only actions and links have accessible names.
- [ ] Skeletons and updates avoid disruptive announcements.

## Verification

- [ ] `pnpm docs:check`
- [ ] `pnpm format:check`
- [ ] `pnpm architecture:check`
- [ ] `pnpm -r --if-present typecheck`
- [ ] Backoffice tests
- [ ] Backoffice build
- [ ] Relevant booking and reputation tests
- [ ] Relevant tenant, authorization, contract, and cloud-database tests
- [ ] Browser console and hydration checked
- [ ] Screenshots captured at approved widths
- [ ] No lint result claimed because Backoffice has no lint script
