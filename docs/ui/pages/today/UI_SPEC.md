# Today dashboard — UI specification

Status: Current design reference

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA product and engineering

Last updated: 2026-10-01

## Authority and route maturity

`/aujourdhui` is an authenticated, establishment-scoped Server Component. The
`internal` profile integrates current Booking and Reputation sources;
`release-a` integrates only the accepted Google projection. Both preserve the
shared shell, tenant selection, and server authentication.

The written scope and current repository behavior take precedence over
`references/today-dashboard-approved.png`. The reference controls visual
hierarchy, relative proportions, density, spacing direction, and visual tone
only.

## Header

Show:

- the establishment-local date;
- `Bonjour, <display name>.`;
- `Voici votre plan d’action pour aujourd’hui.`;
- an `Ajouter` action only when at least one supported, permission-allowed
  destination exists.

In internal, the first supported add destination is reservation creation. A
shows no Booking add action. Do not render a menu for one item when a direct
link is clearer, and do not add placeholder
actions.

## Attention summaries

Use a balanced responsive grid. Internal cards are derived from enabled and
authorized current modules:

- `Réservations aujourd’hui`;
- `Avis à traiter` when reputation is available;
- `Services aujourd’hui` when booking administration data is available.

In A, the permitted cards are `Nouveaux avis Google` and `Avis à traiter`,
using local `NEW` and `NEW/TO_PROCESS/DRAFTED/FOLLOW_UP` respectively. Their
links open the scoped Google new/attention lists. They promise no remote
unanswered count or provider reply state.

Each card contains an icon, label, value or explicit state, one supporting
label, and a real destination. Do not render email, content, task, or team
cards. Do not turn unavailable capabilities into misleading zero counts.

## Main content

### Reservations today

This section applies to `internal` only.

This is the dominant task surface. Show a limited chronological list containing
only fields returned by the current reservation source:

- local time;
- guest display name;
- party size;
- reservation status;
- link to the existing detail route when permitted.

Do not invent table assignment or phone display. Status filters are added only
when their semantics and interaction are implemented and tested.

### Booking services today

This section applies to `internal` only.

Derive service tiles from today's enabled persisted booking service periods.
Show service name, local time range, capacity when appropriate, and a textual
current/upcoming/completed state when deterministically derived.

Do not add operational opening, cleaning, preparation, closing, reservation
cut-off, or last-arrival fields.

### Reviews requiring attention

Render only when the reputation entitlement and permission apply. Show current
source, author, rating when present, a safely truncated excerpt, received time,
and a real link to the reviews workflow. Do not fabricate source metadata or
reply state.

In A, render only scoped Google rows in the single-column content area. Place
the existing token-free setup/recovery summary before the review panel when
applicable: OWNER gets the permitted setup link; other roles get an operator
handoff. An empty bound inbox establishes no import outcome; stored rows and
local replies establish no provider provenance/publication. The
[Today Product home](../../../features/today/README.md#accepted-release-a-projection)
owns the queue semantics.

## Layout

In internal, at wide desktop widths:

- the summary row appears below the header;
- reservations occupy the dominant column;
- booking services and reviews form secondary cards;
- the grid uses `minmax(0, 1fr)` and current spacing tokens.

In internal, at tablet widths, cards form a balanced one- or two-column layout.
At mobile widths, use this order:

1. header and supported add action;
2. attention summaries;
3. reservations;
4. booking services;
5. reviews.

In A, use responsive summary cards above a single-column Google content area
at every width. Order: header, new/attention summaries, applicable setup/recovery,
review preview. No Booking panel or link occupies an empty placeholder column.

No breakpoint may introduce horizontal page scrolling.

## Language and visual system

- User-facing copy is French, following current Backoffice conventions.
- Do not introduce an i18n framework for this page.
- Reuse `@yuta/ui`, semantic tokens, and `lucide-react`.
- Preserve Geist Sans and current shell typography.
- Use restrained semantic status colors and no raw reference-image colors.
- Do not add gradients, charts, glass effects, or a second token system.

## Required states

Each supported section implements, as applicable:

- loading with stable skeleton dimensions;
- populated;
- valid empty;
- forbidden or capability-hidden;
- unavailable or error;
- retry or recovery where a safe current pattern exists.

One section failure must not be represented as a successful zero value.

## Accessibility

- Use one page-level `h1` and logical section headings.
- Preserve visible focus and keyboard navigation.
- Icon-only actions have accessible names.
- Status includes text and does not rely on color.
- Links describe their destination.
- Skeletons and updates avoid disruptive announcements.

## Intentional deviations from the reference

- Existing Backoffice navigation and shell remain authoritative.
- Tasks, team, emails, and content approval are omitted.
- Reservations do not show unsupported table or phone fields.
- Booking services omit cut-off and last-arrival information.
- The number of summary and content cards is lower and capability-dependent.
- A omits the internal reference's Booking hierarchy and uses the approved
  Google-only composition without changing the shared visual system.
