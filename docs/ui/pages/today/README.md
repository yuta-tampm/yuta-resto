# Today dashboard

Status: Current implemented page package

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA product and engineering

Prompt snapshot topology: GENERATED_SNAPSHOTS

Prompt provenance: prompt-provenance.json

Last updated: 2026-08-08

Route: `/aujourdhui`

Application: `apps/backoffice`

## Current status

The route is integrated inside the authenticated Backoffice shell. Its Server
Component composes establishment-scoped reservations, booking service periods
with dated exceptions, and entitled reputation feedback from current cloud
repositories. Each section has independent ready, empty, unavailable, and,
where applicable, hidden states.

The former fixture-only dashboard component and its unsupported financial and
placeholder modules have been removed.

The current repository provides real, establishment-scoped sources for:

- reservations;
- booking service periods and settings;
- reputation feedback when the entitlement is enabled;
- authenticated user, organization, establishment, locale, timezone, role, and
  entitlement context.

Daily tasks, team planning, content approval, and generic email workflows still
do not have current dashboard-ready domain implementations and are intentionally
absent from the route.
