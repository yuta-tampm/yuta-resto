# Tenant and User Foundation

Status: Current

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA engineering

`docs/architecture/AUTHENTICATION.md`

## Implemented scope

YUTA cloud identity and restaurant authorization use three separate records:

- `users` stores the internal human identity and optional YUTA system role;
- `organizations` and `establishments` store the approved cloud ownership
  hierarchy;
- `tenant_memberships` grants a user access to a restaurant establishment.

This follows `docs/architecture/TENANCY.md`: "tenant" is a runtime
context and not a database table. POS operational data remains local and has no
dependency on this foundation.

The user schema includes a unique external `authProviderId`, normalized email,
nullable display name, `ACTIVE`/`DISABLED` status, nullable `YUTA_ADMIN` or
`YUTA_SUPPORT` system role, and audit timestamps. Password fields remain only
for the current first-party back-office credential adapter.

Memberships use `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, or `STAFF`, are unique per user and
organization/establishment scope, include `joinedAt`, and use restrictive
foreign keys. Manager actions are limited to staff. Each establishment must
retain one active owner.

## Authentication adapters

`@yuta/auth` exports `AuthAdapter`, `AuthenticatedIdentity`, and
`createAuthService`. Provider payloads stop at the adapter. Domain code receives
only the internal `SessionUser`. Missing identities are unauthenticated;
disabled internal users are denied; system roles are checked explicitly.

The portable auth service also exposes the bounded GLOBAL YUTA Formalités
template authority foundation. It accepts only the five approved closed
operations, grants each explicitly to `YUTA_ADMIN`, grants none to
`YUTA_SUPPORT`, and returns a minimized system context only for a trusted active
internal user. This system-only path does not construct or consume
`TenantContext`, does not authorize tenant resources, and has no application,
persistence, template-lifecycle, or production side effect. The normative
behavior is in the
[Platform Admin Formalités template authorization specification](../../openspec/specs/authorization/platform-admin-formalites-template-administration/spec.md).

The current back-office password flow continues to use opaque, hashed,
database-backed sessions. A future external provider implements `AuthAdapter`
and uses `createInternalUserLookup` from `@yuta/db-cloud`.

## Tenant selection

The existing back-office session is an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax active-tenant
cookie. Switching revalidates active membership and rotates the session token.
The reusable tenant service additionally supports trusted route slugs and the
single-membership fallback. Multiple memberships without a selected tenant
produce a selection-required result.

Credential authentication with several active establishments creates a
single-use `auth_selection_tickets` record valid for 10 minutes. Its opaque
token is held in a separate HttpOnly cookie. The selection action accepts only
`membershipId`, validates ownership and every active status, consumes the
ticket atomically, and then creates the regular scoped `auth_sessions` record.
The session's organization and establishment columns remain non-null.

The restaurant back-office uses these selection routes:

```text
/acces/aucun-etablissement
/selection-etablissement
/resolution-etablissement
```

The recovery route revokes an invalid existing scope and reruns the zero/one/many
membership resolution.

## Development identities and seed environment

The idempotent cloud seed creates three separate identities:

| Identity                     | Scope                  | Role                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner@luna-restaurant.fr`   | LUNA and LuNa Poitiers | `OWNER` membership in both establishments          |
| `manager@luna-restaurant.fr` | LUNA                   | `MANAGER` in the original establishment only       |
| `admin@yutapro.fr`           | YuTa platform          | `YUTA_ADMIN` system role, no restaurant membership |

For the current password adapter, set:

```text
YUTA_CLOUD_SEED_PASSWORD
```

Seed execution requires the password. `pnpm dev:env:sync` generates and retains
a random local value in the ignored package environment file; deployments must
supply their own value. No stable fallback password is stored in source or
documentation.

## Development commands

```bash
pnpm db:cloud:migrate
pnpm db:cloud:seed
```

To recreate all isolated development databases and seed them:

```bash
CONFIRM_DB_RESET=true SEED_DB_RESET=true pnpm db:reset:dev
```

The reset script refuses `NODE_ENV=production` and requires explicit
confirmation.

## Deferred work

Invitations, public signup, custom roles, billing, ownership transfer, audited
support access, impersonation, platform-admin UI, and tenant deletion remain
out of scope. A YUTA system role does not grant restaurant access.
