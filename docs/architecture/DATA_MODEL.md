# YUTA Database Model Reference

Status: Current reference

Visibility: Engineering

Authority: current Drizzle schemas and `docs/architecture/DATABASE_BOUNDARIES.md`

This is a human-readable reference. Current Drizzle schemas remain executable
authority whenever exact columns, constraints, or enum values differ.

## 1. Critical correction: there is no `tenants` table

YUTA does **not** persist a table named `tenants` and does **not** use a generic
`tenant_id` column.

The persisted cloud hierarchy is:

```text
organization
└── establishment
```

In application code, the word **tenant** means a resolved authorization and
data-isolation context. It is not the name of a database entity.

```ts
type TenantContext = {
  organizationId: string;
  establishmentId: string | null;
  actor: TenantActor;
  locale: string;
  timezone: string;
  entitlements: ReadonlySet<string>;
};
```

For restaurant-specific back-office operations, `establishmentId` is required.
An organization can own one or more establishments. An establishment represents
a restaurant/site/branch.

### Never make these assumptions

- Do not create or query a `tenants` table.
- Do not add `tenantId`/`tenant_id` to cloud or POS tables.
- Do not add `tenantId` directly to `users`.
- Do not treat an organization and an establishment as interchangeable.
- Do not grant access from a browser-supplied organization or establishment ID.
- Do not let `YUTA_ADMIN` or `YUTA_SUPPORT` silently bypass restaurant
  membership checks.
- Do not add cloud tenant columns to the local POS database.
- Do not synchronize POS operational data into the cloud database.

## 2. Physical database boundaries

YUTA has three independent database ownership boundaries.

| Boundary   | Runtime owner                             | Connection variable    | Purpose                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud SaaS | `packages/db-cloud`                       | `CLOUD_DATABASE_URL`   | Identity, tenancy, reputation, public booking, and approved SaaS data        |
| Local POS  | `apps/site-agent` using `packages/db-pos` | `POS_DATABASE_URL`     | Local staff/PIN auth, catalog, orders, payments, checks, discounts, printing |
| Display    | `apps/yuta-display/src/db`                | `DISPLAY_DATABASE_URL` | Standalone signage media                                                     |

These databases use separate credentials, migrations, schemas, and failure
domains. Browser code receives no database connection string.

## 3. Cloud ownership and scoping rules

Cloud records use one of these scopes:

1. **Global identity:** no organization scope, for example `users`.
2. **Organization-owned:** contains non-null `organization_id`.
3. **Restaurant/branch-owned:** contains non-null `organization_id` and
   non-null `establishment_id`.

Every tenant-owned repository method must receive the required scope
explicitly. Reads, updates, and deletes must include scope predicates even when
the resource ID is globally unique.

```ts
where(
  and(
    eq(feedbackItems.id, feedbackId),
    eq(feedbackItems.organizationId, context.organizationId),
    eq(feedbackItems.establishmentId, context.establishmentId),
  ),
);
```

An unscoped query such as `where(eq(feedbackItems.id, feedbackId))` is invalid.

## 4. Cloud identity and authorization model

```text
users 1 ─── N tenant_memberships N ─── 1 organizations
                                  └──── 0..1 establishments
```

A user is one human identity and can have memberships in multiple restaurants,
including restaurants owned by different organizations.

### Tenant roles

Stored in `tenant_memberships.role`:

```text
OWNER
MANAGER
STAFF
```

- `OWNER`: manages tenant settings and memberships.
- `MANAGER`: may manage staff only.
- `STAFF`: operational access only.
- The last active owner of an establishment cannot be downgraded or suspended.

### System roles

Stored separately in nullable `users.system_role`:

```text
YUTA_ADMIN
YUTA_SUPPORT
```

System roles are for future YUTA platform administration. They do not create a
membership and do not automatically grant access to any restaurant.

### Active tenant resolution

Server-side resolution order:

1. trusted route establishment ID or globally unique establishment slug;
2. active establishment from the validated server session/HttpOnly cookie;
3. the user's only active membership;
4. require tenant selection when zero or multiple active memberships remain.

The selected organization is derived from the validated membership. It is not
accepted directly from the browser.

For first-party password login, zero/one/many active establishment memberships
are resolved before a scoped session is created. Multiple memberships produce a
single-use 10-minute `auth_selection_tickets` token. The browser submits only a
`membershipId`; the server derives organization and establishment IDs, consumes
the ticket, and creates `auth_sessions` with both scope columns non-null.

## 5. Implemented cloud schema

Executable schema location: `packages/db-cloud/src/schema`.

### `users`

Global human identity. It has no organization, establishment, or tenant ID.

```text
id uuid PK                         application-generated UUIDv7
auth_provider_id varchar(191)     NOT NULL, unique
display_name varchar(160)         nullable
email varchar(320)                NOT NULL, unique on lower(email)
status user_status                ACTIVE | DISABLED
system_role system_role           nullable; YUTA_ADMIN | YUTA_SUPPORT
password_hash text                nullable; current first-party password adapter
email_verified_at timestamptz     nullable
last_login_at timestamptz         nullable
auth_version integer              NOT NULL, default 0
created_at timestamptz            NOT NULL
updated_at timestamptz            NOT NULL
```

Disabled users do not receive a valid application session. Provider payloads
are mapped to this internal record through the auth adapter; they do not flow
through the domain layer.

### `organizations`

Top-level cloud account/group.

```text
id uuid PK
name varchar(255)
slug varchar(100)                 globally unique on lower(slug)
status organization_status       active | disabled
locale varchar(35)                default fr-FR
timezone varchar(100)             default Europe/Paris
currency varchar(3)               default EUR
created_at, updated_at timestamptz
```

### `establishments`

Restaurant/site/branch belonging to an organization.

```text
id uuid PK
organization_id uuid FK -> organizations.id, NOT NULL
name varchar(255)
slug varchar(100)                 globally unique on lower(slug)
status organization_status       active | disabled
locale varchar(35)                default fr-FR
timezone varchar(100)             default Europe/Paris
description text                  nullable
address_line_1, address_line_2    nullable
postal_code, city, country_code   nullable
phone, email, website             nullable primary contact
public_phone, public_email        nullable public contact
logo_url, cover_image_url         nullable HTTP(S) media references
languages varchar[]               public language identifiers
service_modes establishment_service_mode[]
public_* boolean                  optional-field visibility controls
created_at, updated_at timestamptz
```

General restaurant identity and public profile data is owned by
`establishments`, independently of feature entitlements. `booking_settings`
does not own address, contact, logo, cover, language, or service-mode data.

### `tenant_memberships`

Relationship granting a user access to an organization/establishment scope.
The word `tenant` in this table name is historical/domain terminology; it does
not imply a `tenants` table.

```text
id uuid PK
user_id uuid FK -> users.id ON DELETE RESTRICT
organization_id uuid FK -> organizations.id, NOT NULL
establishment_id uuid FK -> establishments.id, nullable
role cloud_role                  OWNER | MANAGER | STAFF
status membership_status        active | suspended
joined_at timestamptz
created_at, updated_at timestamptz
```

Unique key:

```text
(user_id, organization_id, establishment_id)
```

This unique index strictly prevents duplicate establishment-level memberships.
Because PostgreSQL treats `NULL` values as distinct by default, duplicate
organization-level rows with a null establishment would require an additional
constraint before that extension point is activated.

Current back-office authentication requires an active establishment-level
membership. The nullable establishment field preserves an organization-level
authorization extension point but is not a substitute for restaurant scope.

### `tenant_domains`

Maps a public hostname to an organization and establishment.

```text
id uuid PK
organization_id uuid FK -> organizations.id
establishment_id uuid FK -> establishments.id
hostname varchar(253)             globally unique
status domain_status              pending | active | disabled
is_primary boolean
verified_at timestamptz nullable
created_at, updated_at timestamptz
```

### `tenant_entitlements`

Feature flags for one establishment.

```text
organization_id uuid FK -> organizations.id
establishment_id uuid FK -> establishments.id
key varchar(150)
enabled boolean
created_at, updated_at timestamptz
PK (organization_id, establishment_id, key)
```

### Cloud authentication tables

- `auth_sessions`: hashed opaque session token, user, organization,
  establishment, auth version, expiry/revocation and privacy-safe request
  metadata.
- `auth_selection_tickets`: hashed, single-use, 10-minute pre-scope token tied
  to a user and authentication version; it contains no organization or
  establishment scope.
- `password_reset_tokens`: hashed, expiring, single-use reset tokens.
- `auth_login_attempts`: hashed rate-limit key and attempt timestamp.
- `auth_audit_events`: actor, subject, optional organization/establishment scope,
  event name and JSON metadata.

`auth_sessions` always stores the active `organization_id` and
`establishment_id`. The session scope is revalidated against an active user,
organization, establishment, and membership on protected server operations.

### Cloud reputation tables

| Table                      | Scope                          | Purpose                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `feedback_items`           | organization + establishment   | Canonical Google/direct feedback inbox item                        |
| `feedback_replies`         | organization + parent feedback | Drafted/published replies                                          |
| `direct_customer_feedback` | organization + establishment   | Private customer details and consent for direct feedback           |
| `feedback_internal_notes`  | organization + parent feedback | Internal staff notes                                               |
| `reputation_connectors`    | organization + establishment   | Google location connection and encrypted credentials               |
| `reputation_settings`      | organization + establishment   | Brand voice, public feedback slug, notification and reply settings |
| `reputation_audit_events`  | organization + entity          | Reputation mutation audit trail                                    |

Relevant implemented enum values:

```text
feedback_source: GOOGLE | DIRECT
feedback_type: PUBLIC_REVIEW | DIRECT_FEEDBACK
feedback_sentiment: POSITIVE | NEUTRAL | NEGATIVE
feedback_urgency: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
feedback_status: NEW | TO_PROCESS | DRAFTED | REPLIED | FOLLOW_UP |
                 RESOLVED | ARCHIVED | SPAM
feedback_reply_status: DRAFT | READY | PUBLISHED | FAILED | DELETED
reputation_connector_status: DISCONNECTED | CONNECTING | CONNECTED |
                             ERROR | AUTH_EXPIRED
```

### Cloud public-booking tables

The executable booking schema is `packages/db-cloud/src/schema/booking.ts`.
All restaurant-owned booking records carry organization and establishment
scope. Current tables are:

- `booking_settings`;
- `booking_service_periods`;
- `booking_exceptions`;
- `reservations`;
- `reservation_status_history`;
- `reservation_internal_notes`;
- `booking_audit_events`;
- `booking_notification_deliveries`;
- `booking_public_attempts`.

The public booking application resolves an establishment server-side. Public
management tokens are stored as hashes, capacity-sensitive creation is
transactional, and browser-provided scope is never authoritative.

`booking_settings` owns reservation availability and policy only. Public
booking branding and visible contact/address values are read from the canonical
establishment profile and filtered by its visibility flags.

### Cloud personnel read foundation

`personnel_employee_dossiers` stores the approved minimum employment facts for
one establishment. Every row carries `organization_id` and `establishment_id`;
a composite foreign key prevents pairing an establishment with the wrong
organization. Repository reads repeat both scope predicates even when the
employee ID is globally unique.

The table stores names, poste, qualification, employment-term type, optional
expected end date, work-time category, entry date, optional departure date,
revision, and server timestamps. Display name, employment view, completeness,
filters, and summary counts are derived rather than stored.

The development create slice also owns `personnel_employee_audit_events` and
`personnel_command_receipts`. One transaction creates the dossier, appends the
allowlisted creation/duplicate-override audit event, and stores the hashed
idempotency receipt. Receipts contain no duplicate employee payload. Editing,
departure, documents, payroll, register, and Formalités data are not active.

## 6. Local POS schema

Executable schema location: `packages/db-pos/src/schema`.

The POS installation represents one local restaurant/site. POS business tables
do not use `organization_id`, `establishment_id`, `tenant_id`, the cloud
`users` table, or `tenant_memberships`.

Implemented POS tables:

```text
local_users
local_auth_sessions
local_auth_login_attempts
menu_categories
menu_items
combo_rules
combo_rule_groups
combo_rule_group_items
orders
order_items
order_discounts
order_discount_items
checks
check_items
check_discounts
check_discount_items
payments
print_jobs
```

Important POS role/status values:

```text
local_user_role: admin | manager | staff | kitchen
order_status: draft | sent | preparing | ready | served | paid | cancelled
order_item_status: pending | sent | preparing | ready | served | cancelled
payment_method: cash | card | ticket_resto | other
payment_status: pending | paid | failed | refunded
print_job_status: pending | printing | printed | failed
```

Cloud role names and local POS role names are intentionally separate concepts.

## 7. Display schema

Executable schema location: `apps/yuta-display/src/db/schema`.

The display product is standalone and currently owns one table:

```text
display_media
- id
- title
- type
- file_url
- file_name
- mime_type
- size
- duration
- sort_order
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at
```

Do not create `packages/db-display` unless a second legitimate server-side
consumer needs this schema.

## 8. Current development seed

The cloud foundation seed creates/reuses:

```text
organization:  LUNA / slug luna / active
establishment: LUNA / slug luna / active
establishment: LuNa Poitiers / slug luna-poitiers / active
membership:    owner@luna-restaurant.fr / OWNER / active
membership:    owner@luna-restaurant.fr / OWNER at LuNa Poitiers / active
membership:    manager@luna-restaurant.fr / MANAGER / active
system user:   admin@yutapro.fr / YUTA_ADMIN / no tenant membership
domains:       luna.localhost, luna-poitiers.localhost
```

The three development identities use the required seed password configured by:

```text
YUTA_CLOUD_SEED_PASSWORD
```

`pnpm dev:env:sync` generates a random local value in the ignored environment
file. `admin@yuta.local` is a retired cloud seed identity and is disabled and
stripped of restaurant memberships when the seed runs.

## 9. Source-of-truth precedence

When documents or prompts disagree, use this order:

1. Current Drizzle schemas in `packages/db-cloud`, `packages/db-pos`, and
   `apps/yuta-display/src/db`.
2. `docs/architecture/DATABASE_BOUNDARIES.md` and `TENANCY.md`.
3. This reference and current feature/product documentation.
4. Accepted ADRs.
5. Older implementation proposals or chat history.

Any older specification proposing a persisted `tenants` table or generic
`tenant_id` columns is obsolete for this repository and must not be followed.
