# YUTA Documentation Index

Status: Current

Visibility: Engineering

Owner: YUTA engineering

Last updated: 2026-08-09

## Authority order

1. `CURRENT_STATE.md`
2. `architecture/`
3. the relevant document under `features/` or `products/`
4. `operations/`
5. accepted records under `decisions/`
6. code and tests as implementation evidence

Completed plans, audits, migration checkpoints, and implementation reports are
not current architecture authority. Git history preserves that record.

## Documentation visibility

- `Visibility: Public product` describes capabilities approved for public,
  pricing, commercial, partner, and customer-facing communication.
- `Visibility: Engineering` may describe every maintained runtime, including
  POS, Site Agent, Display, devices, printing, offline behavior, and local data.
- `Visibility: Local operator` is intended for restaurant operation.

Visibility labels define communication scope, not confidentiality. Secrets and
sensitive details never belong in the repository.

Completed task specifications are removed after durable behavior is reflected
in current feature documentation and remaining work is captured in `STATUS.md`.

## Maintenance

- Update an existing current document instead of adding an overlapping report.
- Remove superseded plans only after durable rules have been extracted.
- Keep `packages/ui/src/index.ts` authoritative for public UI exports; do not
  duplicate its catalog in instruction files.
- Check links after moving or deleting files.
- Public-product documents must not promote local operational workflows as
  YUTA public-service capabilities.
