## 0. Purpose

This document is the master specification for building the YuTa internal restaurant POS MVP.

The app is for internal restaurant operations only. The restaurant already uses a separate certified cash register system, so fiscal/tax-compliant receipts, VAT accounting, and legal cash-register certification are out of scope for this MVP.

The MVP must be simple, reliable, tablet-friendly, and able to run on a local mini PC server 24/7.

## 1. Repository Fit

YuTa is an existing pnpm monorepo. The POS MVP must follow the current repository conventions instead of creating a greenfield structure.

Use:

```txt
apps/yuta-pos       Local POS client, kitchen workflow, payments, and management UI
apps/site-agent     Local API, persistence, printing, and device-integration boundary
packages/db-pos     Local POS database schema, migrations, repositories, and seed data
packages/core       Shared business logic where appropriate
packages/ui         Shared UI component library (@yuta/ui)
```

`apps/backoffice` is a cloud application and must not own or manage local POS
operational data.

Important exception:

```txt
apps/yuta-display
```

`apps/yuta-display` is a separate signage app and keeps its own local database
setup. Do not move or merge the display database into `packages/db-pos` as part
of the POS MVP.

## 2. Tech Stack

Use the existing project stack:

```txt
pnpm
Next.js App Router
React 19
TypeScript strict mode
Tailwind CSS 4
PostgreSQL
Drizzle ORM
Zod
Docker Compose
Local server
Tailscale remote access
```

All UI must use `@yuta/ui`. Do not introduce MUI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Mantine, or another component library. Use `lucide-react` for icons.

## 3. Language Rules

- Code, comments, types, variables, commit messages, and documentation: English.
- `apps/yuta-pos` UI text: French.
- Admin POS UI text: French.

## 4. Core POS Flow

The MVP must support this main flow:

```txt
Create order
  -> enter table label as free text
  -> add menu items quickly
  -> send items to kitchen
  -> kitchen prepares items
  -> payment screen
  -> auto-apply combo discounts
  -> full payment or split payment
  -> close order
```

There is no table management module for MVP. Do not create a table map, table state screen, or `restaurant_tables` table.

Store table information as:

```ts
orders.tableLabel: string;
```

Examples:

```txt
Table 3
Terrasse 5
Emporter
Uber Eats
Deliveroo
Client Martin
```

## 5. Business Rules

### 5.1 Historical Accuracy

Menu prices and names can change later. Old orders must remain correct.

Every order item must store snapshots:

```txt
itemNameSnapshot
unitPriceCentsSnapshot
kitchenStationSnapshot
```

### 5.2 Kitchen Display

Kitchen must see real production items only. Kitchen must not see combo names or combo discounts.

Example:

```txt
Customer gets Gua Bao Happy from Gua Bao - Porc laque + The glace maison 25 cl.
Kitchen and caisse see the two production items, not the formula name.
```

Combos are payment/discount logic, not kitchen production logic.

### 5.3 Combo Handling

Staff should add individual menu items quickly without thinking about combos.

Correct workflow:

```txt
Add Gua Bao - Porc laque 11 EUR
Add The glace maison 25 cl 3.50 EUR

At payment:
System detects Gua Bao Happy = 12.50 EUR
System adds discount -2 EUR

Final:
Gua Bao - Porc laque 11 EUR
The glace maison 25 cl 3.50 EUR
Gua Bao Happy discount -2 EUR
Total 12.50 EUR
```

Combos are represented as automatic discounts. Do not replace order items with combo items.

### 5.4 Split Payment

The system must support:

```txt
1. Pay full order
2. Split by items
3. Split equally
```

Rules:

- Full payment optimizes combo discounts on the whole order.
- Split by items creates checks and recalculates combo discounts inside each check.
- Split equally optimizes the full order first, then divides the final total.
- For split by items, combo discounts apply only inside the same check.
- Replacing an unpaid split marks old open checks as `void`.
- Once any split check is paid, the split mode cannot be replaced.

### 5.5 No Hard Delete

Do not hard-delete historical data:

```txt
orders
order_items
payments
discounts
checks
print_jobs
```

Use statuses such as:

```txt
cancelled
void
refunded
failed
```

## 6. Status Model

### 6.1 Order Status

```ts
type OrderStatus =
  | 'draft'
  | 'sent'
  | 'preparing'
  | 'ready'
  | 'served'
  | 'paid'
  | 'cancelled';
```

Normal flow:

```txt
draft -> sent -> preparing -> ready -> served -> paid
```

Cancelled flow:

```txt
draft/sent/preparing/ready/served -> cancelled
```

### 6.2 Order Item Status

```ts
type OrderItemStatus =
  | 'pending'
  | 'sent'
  | 'preparing'
  | 'ready'
  | 'served'
  | 'cancelled';
```

Rules:

- `pending` items can be edited freely.
- `sent`, `preparing`, `ready`, and `served` items should not be deleted.
- Sent or later items can only be cancelled.
- Kitchen display shows `sent` and `preparing` items.
- Ready items can be shown separately or hidden depending on UI.
- For MVP, status applies to the whole order item row quantity. Partial kitchen status for a single row is out of scope.

## 7. Database Rules

Use PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM in `packages/db-pos`. `apps/site-agent` is the
runtime owner of this package; browser code and cloud applications must not
connect to the local POS database directly.

General rules:

- Use UUID primary keys.
- Use integer cents for money fields. Never use floats for money.
- Use enums where appropriate.
- Add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` where records can change.
- Add indexes for common lookup fields such as `orderId`, `checkId`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `orderNumber`.
- Use foreign keys.
- Keep snapshot fields for historical accuracy.
- VAT/tax-compliant receipt fields are out of scope for MVP.

## 8. Database Tables

### 8.1 users

```ts
users {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'staff' | 'kitchen';
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.2 menu_categories

```ts
menuCategories {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sortOrder: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.3 menu_items

```ts
menuItems {
  id: string;
  categoryId: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  priceCents: number;
  kitchenStation: 'kitchen' | 'bar' | 'dessert' | 'none';
  orderingPolicy: 'merge' | 'separate';
  variantOptions: Array<{ code: string; label: string }>;
  requiredVariantQuantity: number;
  isAvailable: boolean;
  sortOrder: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Menu items are real sellable items. `orderingPolicy` controls whether repeated
pending additions merge or create one quantity-one row per portion.
`variantOptions` and `requiredVariantQuantity` define catalog-driven choices;
the service validates the configured total per ordered portion without
matching item names. Do not represent combo rules as normal menu items for MVP.

### 8.4 orders

```ts
orders {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  tableLabel: string;
  orderType: 'dine_in' | 'takeaway' | 'delivery';
  status: 'draft' | 'sent' | 'preparing' | 'ready' | 'served' | 'paid' | 'cancelled';

  subtotalCents: number;
  discountCents: number;
  totalCents: number;

  paymentMode: 'single' | 'split_by_items' | 'split_equally';
  note?: string;
  createdBy: string;

  sentAt?: Date;
  paidAt?: Date;
  cancelledAt?: Date;
  cancelledReason?: string;

  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.5 order_items

```ts
orderItems {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  menuItemId: string;

  itemNameSnapshot: string;
  unitPriceCentsSnapshot: number;
  kitchenStationSnapshot: 'kitchen' | 'bar' | 'dessert' | 'none';

  quantity: number;
  note?: string;

  status: 'pending' | 'sent' | 'preparing' | 'ready' | 'served' | 'cancelled';

  sentAt?: Date;
  readyAt?: Date;
  servedAt?: Date;
  cancelledAt?: Date;
  cancelledReason?: string;

  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.6 combo_rules

```ts
comboRules {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  pricingMode: 'fixed' | 'base_item_plus_delta';
  comboPriceCents: number;
  priceDeltaCents: number;
  basePricingGroupName?: string;
  priority: number;
  maxApplications?: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Lower `priority` means higher priority.

### 8.7 combo_rule_groups

```ts
comboRuleGroups {
  id: string;
  comboRuleId: string;
  name: string;
  minQuantity: number;
  maxQuantity: number;
  sortOrder: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.8 combo_rule_group_items

```ts
comboRuleGroupItems {
  id: string;
  comboRuleGroupId: string;
  menuItemId: string;
  extraPriceCents: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.9 order_discounts

```ts
orderDiscounts {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  comboRuleId?: string;
  nameSnapshot: string;
  discountCents: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.10 order_discount_items

```ts
orderDiscountItems {
  id: string;
  orderDiscountId: string;
  orderItemId: string;
  quantityApplied: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.11 checks

```ts
checks {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  checkLabel: string;
  splitMode: 'items' | 'equal';
  status: 'open' | 'paid' | 'void';

  subtotalCents: number;
  discountCents: number;
  totalCents: number;

  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

For equal split checks, `check_items` may be empty and the check total is stored directly on the check.

### 8.12 check_items

```ts
checkItems {
  id: string;
  checkId: string;
  orderItemId: string;
  quantity: number;
  amountCentsSnapshot: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.13 check_discounts

```ts
checkDiscounts {
  id: string;
  checkId: string;
  comboRuleId?: string;
  nameSnapshot: string;
  discountCents: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.14 check_discount_items

```ts
checkDiscountItems {
  id: string;
  checkDiscountId: string;
  checkItemId: string;
  quantityApplied: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 8.15 payments

```ts
payments {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  checkId?: string;

  method: 'cash' | 'card' | 'ticket_resto' | 'other';
  amountCents: number;
  tenderedCents?: number;
  changeCents?: number;
  tipCents: number;

  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed' | 'refunded';

  paidBy?: string;
  paidAt?: Date;
  refundedAt?: Date;
  refundReason?: string;

  createdAt: Date;
}
```

Rules:

- `amountCents` is the amount applied to the order or check.
- For cash, `tenderedCents` is the money received and `changeCents` is the change returned.
- Full order payment uses `checkId = null`.
- Split payment points `checkId` to the relevant check.
- Mark an order as paid only when the correct amount has been paid.

### 8.16 print_jobs

```ts
printJobs {
  id: string;

  source: 'pos' | 'kitchen' | 'delivery' | 'manual';
  printerName: string;

  jobType: 'kitchen_ticket' | 'customer_receipt' | 'test';
  status: 'pending' | 'printing' | 'printed' | 'failed';

  payload: json;
  errorMessage?: string;

  createdAt: Date;
  printedAt?: Date;
}
```

`customer_receipt` is created only by the explicit paid receipt command on the
order-detail route. Payment flows do not create it automatically. The job stores
an immutable authoritative local snapshot and represents one non-fiscal copy;
the browser never supplies receipt lines, totals, printer routing, or ESC/POS.

For MVP, print gateway behavior can run in mock mode and write printable content to logs or files.

## 9. Order Service Requirements

Implement:

```ts
createOrder({ tableLabel, orderType, createdBy });
addOrderItem({ orderId, menuItemId, quantity, note });
updateOrderItemQuantity({ orderItemId, quantity });
cancelOrderItem({ orderItemId, reason });
sendOrderToKitchen(orderId);
markOrderItemPreparing(orderItemId);
markOrderItemSent(orderItemId);
markOrderItemReady(orderItemId);
markOrderItemServed(orderItemId);
getOpenOrders();
getOrderDetail(orderId);
```

Rules:

- `createOrder` creates an order with status `draft`.
- `addOrderItem` copies menu item snapshots into `order_items`.
- Only `pending` items can be modified freely.
- Sent or preparing items cannot be deleted; use cancellation.
- `sendOrderToKitchen` updates pending items to `sent`.
- `sendOrderToKitchen` sets `sentAt`.
- Order totals must be recalculated after item changes.
- Combo discounts should not be calculated inside the basic order service.
- Combo optimization happens at payment or explicitly from the payment screen.

## 10. Combo Engine

Implement:

```ts
optimizeOrderCombos(orderId);
clearOrderComboDiscounts(orderId);
calculateComboDiscountsForItems(items, comboRules);
optimizeCheckCombos(checkId);
clearCheckComboDiscounts(checkId);
```

Rules:

- Apply combo rules by priority.
- Lower priority number means higher priority.
- One item quantity can only be used once.
- If an order item has quantity 3, it can be expanded into 3 unit items internally.
- Do not modify order items.
- Do not replace order items with combo items.
- Only create a discount if `discountCents > 0`.
- Store discount-to-item mapping.
- For `fixed`, combo total is `comboPriceCents + eligible item extras`.
- For `base_item_plus_delta`, combo total is selected base-group item price plus `priceDeltaCents` plus eligible item extras. The base group is identified by `basePricingGroupName`, usually `Plat`.

Tie-breaker for deterministic results:

```txt
When several item combinations match the same combo rule:
1. Choose the combination with the highest positive discount.
2. Then choose older order items first.
3. Then choose lower item id as the final tie-breaker.
```

## 11. Payment and Split Payment

Implement:

```ts
payFullOrder({ orderId, method, amountCents, tenderedCents?, paidBy })
createChecksByItems({ orderId, checks })
splitOrderEqually({ orderId, parts })
payCheck({ checkId, method, amountCents, tenderedCents?, paidBy })
getPaymentSummary(orderId)
```

### 11.1 Full Payment

Flow:

```txt
Open payment screen
  -> run optimizeOrderCombos(orderId)
  -> show final total
  -> create payment
  -> mark order as paid if paid amount covers total
  -> do not create an automatic customer receipt print job
```

### 11.2 Split By Items

Flow:

```txt
Create checks
  -> assign item quantities to each check
  -> validate assigned quantities
  -> run optimizeCheckCombos for each check
  -> each check can be paid separately
  -> order is paid when all checks are paid
  -> do not create an automatic customer receipt print job
```

Assigned check item quantities cannot exceed the original order item quantity.

### 11.3 Split Equally

Flow:

```txt
Run optimizeOrderCombos(orderId)
  -> take final optimized total
  -> split into N checks
  -> handle rounding by cents
  -> each check can be paid separately
```

Rounding rule:

```txt
If total is 10000 cents and parts = 3:
- Part 1: 3334
- Part 2: 3333
- Part 3: 3333
```

The sum must always equal the original optimized total.

## 12. POS UI Requirements

The UI must be simple, tablet-friendly, and in French.

Screens in `apps/yuta-pos`:

```txt
Create order
Order detail
Kitchen
Payment
Split by items
Split equally
```

Do not build a table map.

Use `@yuta/ui` components and YuTa design tokens.

## 13. Admin MVP

Keep POS management local. Provide the management workflows through
`apps/yuta-pos`, backed by `apps/site-agent`:

```txt
Manage menu categories
Manage menu items
Manage combo rules
Manage combo rule groups
Manage combo group items
View daily orders
View daily revenue
```

Rules:

- Combo rules must be configurable without code.
- Extra price per eligible combo item must be supported.
- Menu item availability must be toggleable.

## 14. Print Gateway MVP

The current print gateway uses one EPSON TM-m30 Bluetooth printer for internal
production tickets only.

Required features:

```txt
Create print job by HTTP API or service function
Store job in print_jobs
Worker processes pending jobs
Render ASCII-safe ESC/POS and write to the configured Linux RFCOMM device
Mark job as printed or failed
Retry failed jobs
```

Kitchen tickets are batch-based. If additional items are added after an earlier kitchen send, the next kitchen ticket should contain only the newly sent items.

Physical printer integration remains behind `apps/site-agent`. Each send batch
creates separate `CUISINE` and `BOISSONS & DESSERTS` jobs for the stations that
have items; station `none` is excluded. The one TM-m30 prints and cuts the jobs
sequentially. Local managers configure 1 to 3 copies per destination and a
compact, standard, or large font preset, plus top, left, and bottom ticket
spacing. Jobs snapshot those presentation settings. Cuisine sections are
ordered Entrées, Suppléments, then Plats; counter sections are ordered Boissons
then Desserts. One feed-and-cut runs at the end of each station ticket. Payment never creates a
customer receipt job, and the POS browser
receives no device path or access.
Local managers can enqueue a one-copy test job from printing management. The
test uses persisted presentation settings and validates punctuation
transliteration, allergy emphasis, and the physical cut without creating an
order.

## 15. Implementation Order

Do not build the full system in one giant step.

Recommended order:

```txt
1. Inspect repository structure
2. Create packages/db-pos Drizzle schema
3. Create migrations
4. Add seed data
5. Implement local order services in apps/site-agent
6. Implement combo engine
7. Implement payment/split service
8. Connect the apps/yuta-pos shell to apps/site-agent
9. Build POS order UI
10. Build kitchen screen inside yuta-pos
11. Build payment and split screens
12. Add local menu/combo management screens to apps/yuta-pos
13. Add print job mock workflow
14. Add unit tests
15. Add Docker Compose following `docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
```

## 16. Seed Data

The POS seed is the approved Luna operating catalog, not demonstration menu
fixtures. Its authoritative structured source is
`packages/db-pos/src/luna-seed-data.ts`.

It creates 12 categories and 53 catalog rows across entrees, Bun, Gua Bao,
soups, daily dishes, desserts, soft drinks, cocktails and mocktails, hot
drinks, alcohol, supplements, and formulas. Fifty-two products are available
after a clean seed. `Plat special du samedi` is the additional row; it starts
unavailable at zero price so a manager must enter the weekly description and
price before enabling it.

The seed creates these active combo rules:

```txt
Gua Bao Happy = one Gua Bao + The glace maison 25 cl for 12.50 EUR
Menu Express = eligible main dish + 4 EUR, with one entree or dessert
Menu Gourmand = eligible main dish + 8 EUR, with one entree and one dessert
Combo Ete = daily dish + The glace maison 25 cl for daily dish price + 2.50 EUR
```

Eligible main dishes for Menu Express and Menu Gourmand are all Bun, Gua Bao,
soups, and daily dishes. Seeded products route to `kitchen`, `bar`, or
`dessert`; none uses station `none`.

## 17. Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is acceptable when:

1. Staff can create an order with a free text table label.
2. Staff can add menu items quickly.
3. Staff can send items to kitchen.
4. Kitchen screen shows real items only.
5. Staff can mark items preparing and ready.
6. Payment screen auto-applies combo discounts.
7. Full payment works.
8. Split by items works.
9. Split equally works.
10. Order is marked paid only when all required payments are completed.
11. Historical order data stays correct after menu price changes.
12. Print job mock can create and process print jobs.
13. Unit tests cover core business rules.
