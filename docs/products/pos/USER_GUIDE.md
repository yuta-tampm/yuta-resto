# YuTa POS User Guide

Status: Current

Visibility: Local operator

Owner: YUTA restaurant operations

Last updated: 2026-08-08

This guide describes how to use the current YuTa POS MVP for internal restaurant operations.

The app UI is in French. This documentation is in English to match the repository convention.

The POS runtime uses the local `site-agent` API and db-pos database. Deprecated
POS management pages in the cloud back-office are intentionally omitted from this guide.
Staff, menu/catalog, combo, printer, and operational-report management belong
to a local UI backed by `site-agent`.

## Local URLs

```txt
POS orders:    http://localhost:3003
New POS order: http://localhost:3003/pos
Local management: http://localhost:3003/management
```

The local management shell requires an active local user with the `admin` or
`manager` role and a PIN session issued by `site-agent`.

## Run Locally

Start a local POS PostgreSQL database, apply the db-pos schema, and seed local
users/catalog. Set `POS_DATABASE_URL` from
`packages/db-pos/.env.example` for the database, seed, and `site-agent`
processes:

```bash
docker compose --project-name yuta-pos-dev -f docker-compose.local.dev.yml up -d --wait
pnpm db:pos:migrate
pnpm db:pos:seed
```

Run the local API and POS app in separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:site-agent
pnpm dev:pos
```

Kitchen production commands create durable print jobs in `site-agent`.
Physical internal-ticket printing uses the restaurant Linux server and one
Bluetooth EPSON TM-m30. Customer receipts are not printed.

The QA checklist lives in:

```txt
docs/products/pos/QA_CHECKLIST.md
```

## Install As An App

The production POS can be installed as a PWA on a supported browser. Open the
POS over HTTPS and use the `Installer` action when the installation proposal
appears. The installed POS opens in a standalone window and may expose quick
shortcuts for `Nouvelle commande` and `Cuisine` from the device app launcher.

On iPhone or iPad, use Safari's Share menu and choose `Sur l'ecran d'accueil`.
Safari does not expose the same in-page install proposal as Chromium browsers.

Installing the PWA alone does not make POS operations browser-offline. The app
shell assets may be cached, but creating orders, sending items to the kitchen,
and taking payments still require a working connection to the POS server and
its PostgreSQL database.

When POS, `site-agent`, and PostgreSQL are deployed on the restaurant edge
server, an Internet outage does not stop local operations. The restaurant LAN,
edge server, and database must still be available. Browser-only order entry
while the edge server is unreachable is not supported.

Every POS screen shows a service strip below the main header. This connectivity
probe obtains the local database state from `site-agent`; the browser receives
no database URL:

```txt
En ligne             local server, database, and configured Internet check work
Mode local           local POS works; the configured Internet check is unavailable
Service local        local POS works; no Internet check is configured
Base indisponible    local server responds but PostgreSQL does not
Serveur indisponible browser cannot reach the local POS server
```

`Mode local` is an informational warning, not a reason to stop local cash or
kitchen operations. Follow the payment-terminal procedure before accepting a
card or restaurant-ticket payment during an Internet outage.

## POS Home / Orders

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3003
```

The POS home is the command list for the current service. It lets staff:

```txt
Open active and recent orders
Start a new order from Nouvelle commande
Open the kitchen screen
```

The legacy order-list route `http://localhost:3003/orders` still opens the same command list.

## New Order

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/pos
```

To create an order:

1. Choose the employee in `Employe`.
2. Enter a table or reference in `Table / Repere`.
3. Choose the order type:
   - `Sur place`
   - `A emporter`
   - `Livraison`
4. Add an optional general note when needed.
5. Submit the form.
6. The app opens the item-entry screen so staff can add menu items.

The POS stores the selected employee on the order as `createdBy`. The employee
selector shows active users with `admin`, `manager`, or `staff` roles. If no
active employee exists, order creation is disabled until an employee is created
or reactivated in admin.

## Order Detail

The order detail screen is:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/orders/<orderId>
```

Use it during service to review and act on the current command.

The detail page shows:

```txt
Order reference and status
Active articles
Subtotal, discount, and total
Order timeline with created, kitchen, ready, served, paid, and cancelled states
Order information such as type, table/reference, kitchen printer, and note when present
```

Use `Ajouter` in the `Articles` panel to open the item-entry screen again:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/orders/<orderId>/items
```

Paid and cancelled orders cannot add more items.

### Cancel Order

Use `Annuler la commande` on the order detail page to cancel an unpaid order.

Cancelling an order:

```txt
Marks the order as cancelled
Marks all active articles as cancelled
Voids unpaid split checks
Removes the order from the open command list and kitchen work queue
```

Orders that are already paid, already cancelled, or have a paid payment cannot be cancelled in the MVP. Use a future refund flow for paid orders.

## Add Items

The item-entry screen is:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/orders/<orderId>/items
```

Use it during service to add menu items to the current order.

1. Select a category tab.
2. Search when needed.
3. Tap an item card.
4. The item appears in `Commande actuelle`.

Item name, price, and kitchen station are snapshotted when the item is added. Later menu changes do not rewrite old orders.

Quantity controls follow the kitchen and payment lifecycle:

```txt
pending item                 + and - are available
pending quantity reduced to 0
                             the row is cancelled, never hard-deleted
sent/preparing/ready/served  quantity is locked
same item added after send   creates a new pending kitchen batch
paid or cancelled order      all item changes are locked
recorded partial payment     all item changes are locked
active split checks          all item changes are locked
```

Repeated taps on the same menu item normally merge into its existing pending
row. An item configured as `Une ligne par portion` is the exception: every tap
creates a separate quantity-one row so each plate keeps its own choices in the
order and on the kitchen ticket. The plus control is unavailable on that row;
tap the menu product again to add another plate. Repeated taps never change the
quantity of an item already sent to the kitchen. If an unpaid
split is cancelled and the order returns to single-payment mode, item editing
is available again as long as no payment has been recorded. Quantity changes
keep the row in its original display position; order items are displayed by
creation time with the item ID as a deterministic tie-breaker.

### Item Instructions

Use `Notes / allergie` on a pending article. Preparation preferences are quick
choices tailored to the article or its menu group. The four to six most common
choices are visible immediately; less common choices are under `Autres`.
Choices behave as toggles, and selecting an incompatible choice automatically
removes the previous one. A free-text note of up to 300 characters remains
available. Quick choices are stored as structured code and label snapshots.

The available quick choices and allergen names are local settings. An
administrator or manager can open `Gestion locale > Menu et categories`, then
`Options notes / allergies`, to add, rename, or remove definitions. Quick
instruction lines use `CODE = Libelle | CONFLICT_1, CONFLICT_2`; allergen lines
use `CODE = Libelle`. Codes are stable uppercase identifiers. Remove an
instruction from every category and item before deleting its definition.

Each category selects its common choices and the choices shown under `Autres`.
An item inherits its category by default, but can use a custom list when its
preparation differs. For Luna, `Cocktails & mocktails` includes `Sans alcool`.
These settings stay in the local POS database and are not copied to the cloud.

`Sans cacahuetes` is only a preparation request and never enables the allergy
workflow by itself. If the client reports an allergy, enable `Allergie pour cet
article`, select at least one allergen, and select `Intolerance`, `Allergie`, or
`Allergie severe - traces interdites`. Details are required for `Autre` and are
otherwise optional. Allergy details are limited to 300 characters.

The preference and allergy are attached to that specific item, which supports
tables with multiple guests and different allergies. They are shown directly
below the affected item in the order, kitchen queue, payment summary, and
kitchen ticket. Instructions can be changed only while the item is pending;
they are locked after the item is sent to the kitchen. Never promise that
cross-contamination is impossible without confirmation from the kitchen.

For each item with catalog options, select the configured number of options per
portion before kitchen send. Luna configures `Mochi glacé (2 pcs)` as one row
per portion with `Mangue`, `Matcha`, and `Cacao`, and requires two choices for
that plate. When a pending selection is incomplete, the order screen displays
a French recovery alert and disables `Envoyer en cuisine`. Open
`Notes / allergie` under the highlighted item, complete the required choices,
and save; the send action becomes available without losing the order.

Admins and managers configure this behavior in `/management/catalog` using
`Politique d’ajout`, `Choix requis par portion`, and `Options disponibles`.
Option lines use `CODE = Libellé`; codes must be unique uppercase identifiers.
Luna configures `Menu Petit Enfant` as one row per portion and requires one
choice between `2 nems porc` and `2 nems vegan`.

### Send To Kitchen

On desktop, use `Envoyer en cuisine` at the bottom of `Commande actuelle`,
beside the order-detail action. On smaller screens, open the `Commande actuelle`
drawer and use the same action in its footer, above `Fermer`.

This does three things:

```txt
Marks pending items as sent
Makes items appear on the kitchen screen
Creates a kitchen_ticket print job
```

If no item is pending, the send button is disabled.

If any pending item contains an unacknowledged allergy, the kitchen send opens
a blocking confirmation listing each affected item. The employee must review
the warnings, inform the kitchen, and check `J'ai informe la cuisine` before
sending. The confirmation time and employee are stored on each affected item.
A new allergic item added in a later batch requires a new confirmation.

### Go To Payment

Use `Paiement` to open:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/orders/<orderId>/payment
```

## Kitchen Screen

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3003/kitchen
```

Kitchen staff can filter by station:

```txt
Cuisine
Bar
Dessert
```

Station tabs show the unfinished item count for that station across
`A preparer` and `En preparation`. Items already in `Pret` are not included in
the station badge count. When staff switch station, the POS keeps the current
status if that station has matching items; otherwise it opens the first
unfinished queue for that station, starting with `A preparer`.

The kitchen screen is a production queue, not a full order-history screen.
By default it opens `A preparer` and only loads the selected station/status
queue.
It shows active kitchen work only: items in `sent`, `preparing`, or `ready`.
It is limited to the current service day, from 05:00 to 05:00 local time. This keeps the queue from showing old unfinished history while allowing late-night orders to stay visible after midnight.
When the kitchen screen is open, it refreshes automatically every 10 seconds while the browser tab is visible. This keeps cancelled orders and status changes reasonably fresh without a permanent realtime connection.
Order-level notes are shown on the kitchen screen inside the matching order group, so staff can see general instructions attached during order creation. Item preparation notes and red allergy alerts appear directly below the affected article. Structured quick instructions appear as separate labels and Mochi flavours appear as quantities. Allergy warnings stay expanded above ordinary notes. Kitchen staff must use `Confirmer l'allergie` before an allergic item can become `Pret`; this kitchen confirmation is stored separately from the POS send acknowledgement.

Kitchen staff can switch between:

```txt
A preparer       sent items
En preparation   preparing items
Pret             ready items; paid orders can still be reopened for kitchen corrections
```

The `Tous` view is intentionally not available in the MVP kitchen queue. Use
the POS home/orders list for full command lookup.

Items appear grouped by order/table.

Kitchen item statuses:

```txt
Cuisine      -> sent
Preparation  -> preparing
Pret         -> ready
```

Use:

```txt
Preparer    sent -> preparing
Pret        sent/preparing -> ready
Retour      preparing -> sent, for a mistaken Preparer tap
Reouvrir    ready -> preparing, for a mistaken Pret tap
Envoye      ready -> sent, when the item should return fully to the queue
```

Paid orders can still move through the kitchen workflow. Cancelled orders are read-only on the kitchen screen.

Cancelled items are removed from the active kitchen queue. If restored after being sent, they return to the queue as `sent`.

## Order History

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3003
```

The legacy route `http://localhost:3003/orders` remains available for compatibility.

Views:

```txt
Ouvertes
Payees aujourd hui
Activite aujourd hui
```

Use this page to reopen old or active orders.

The command list uses the same service day as the kitchen screen: 05:00 local
time until 04:59 the next morning. `Ouvertes` shows only unfinished orders
created during that service day. `Payees aujourd hui` uses the payment time;
`Activite aujourd hui` shows orders created or paid during the service day.

## Payment

Open payment from an order with `Paiement`.

The current payment MVP supports:

```txt
Full order payment
Split equally
Split by items
```

The payment page first shows three compact choices:

```txt
Payer tout
Separer par articles
Partager en parts egales
```

Selecting a choice opens the matching payment dialog. This keeps the operator focused on the active payment mode instead of showing all three workflows at once.

`Separer par articles` opens inside the payment dialog. Staff assign item quantities with `-` and `+` controls for each client, then create the client tickets from the same modal without leaving the payment page.
The modal previews combo discounts per active client ticket, not as one order-level discount.
After tickets are created, the payment page reopens the same dialog so staff can immediately collect each client check.
Internally, the redirect uses `paymentDialog=item-split` to reopen that dialog.
When an item split already exists, reopening the dialog restores the existing client count and item quantities from the saved checks.

Combo discounts are optimized at payment time.

### Full Payment

Use the full payment section when one customer pays all or part of the remaining amount.

Payment amount fields use euro values, not cents:

```txt
31
31,00
31.00
```

Do not enter `3100` for 31 EUR.

`Montant a encaisser` is the amount recorded as paid. It cannot exceed the remaining amount.

For `Especes`, `Montant recu du client` can be higher than `Montant a encaisser`; the POS shows the change to return. It can be left empty when the customer gives exactly the amount being collected.

Supported methods:

```txt
cash
card
ticket_resto
other
```

When a payment is saved:

```txt
The paid amount is recorded
The selected POS employee is stored as paidBy
The order stays open until the remaining amount reaches 0
```

Payment submission is committed in one database transaction. Retrying the same
browser submission cannot create a second payment. Payment does not create a
customer receipt print job. The same retry protection applies to a kitchen send
and its internal kitchen ticket job.

When the full order is completely paid:

```txt
The order is marked paid
No customer receipt print job is created
```

### Split Equally

Use equal split when the table wants to divide the total into N parts.

1. Enter the number of parts.
2. Create the split.
3. Pay each check fully or in partial payments.

The order is marked paid only when all checks are paid.

Use the page-level `Annuler le partage` action to return to full-order payment when no split ticket has been paid yet. Once a split ticket is paid, the split cannot be cancelled.

After equal split tickets are created, the payment page reopens the equal split dialog with `paymentDialog=equal-split`. Reopening the dialog restores the existing number of parts from the saved checks instead of defaulting back to 2.

### Split By Items

Open the `Separer par articles` payment choice:

```txt
Payer -> Separer par articles
```

Choose the number of clients directly in the modal. This is independent from equal split.

```txt
Default -> 2 clients
Choose 3 -> Client 1, Client 2, Client 3
Choose 4 -> Client 1, Client 2, Client 3, Client 4
```

Assign item quantities to each client, then create checks. Each check can be
paid fully or in partial payments. Completing a check does not create a
customer receipt print job.

The selected POS employee is stored as `paidBy` for each payment.

Use the page-level `Annuler le partage` action to return to full-order payment when no split ticket has been paid yet. Once a split ticket is paid, the split cannot be cancelled.

## Local POS Staff Management

This workflow belongs to the local POS management UI backed by `site-agent`.
It must not be exposed by the cloud `apps/backoffice` application. Open
`/management`, select an active administrator or manager, and enter the local
PIN. Run `pnpm dev:env:sync` to generate local seed PINs in the ignored
`packages/db-pos/.env.local`, or provide the three `YUTA_POS_SEED_*_PIN`
variables explicitly. Never reuse development PINs in a restaurant deployment.

Open `Gestion locale > Équipe POS` to manage:

```txt
Create employee
Edit name
Edit email
Set role
Activate or deactivate
```

Roles:

```txt
Admin
Manager
Service
Cuisine
```

The POS employee selector shows active users with these roles:

```txt
admin
manager
staff
```

Kitchen-only users are managed here but are not shown in the POS order creator selector.

Do not delete users from the database. Deactivate users to preserve order and payment history.
An administrator can manage every role. A manager can manage only `staff` and
`kitchen` users. The last active administrator cannot be deactivated or
changed to another role. Changing a role, changing a PIN, or deactivating a
user invalidates that user's existing local sessions.

## Local Menu Management

This workflow belongs to the local POS management UI backed by `site-agent`.
Open `Gestion locale > Menu et catégories` to manage:

```txt
Menu categories
Menu items
Item price
Kitchen station
Availability
Sort order
```

Stations:

```txt
Cuisine
Bar
Dessert
Aucune
```

Availability controls whether an item appears in the POS item grid.
A hidden category removes the whole category and its items from new order
entry. An unavailable item remains in local history but is not offered for new
orders. Administrators and managers may perform these changes. Categories and
items are never physically deleted by this workflow.

After a clean Luna seed, `Plat spécial du samedi` is unavailable and has a
zero price. Before Saturday service, an administrator or manager must edit its
description and real selling price, then mark it available. After service,
mark it unavailable again; never sell the zero-price placeholder.

On the order item screen, the search field filters the items in the selected
category immediately as staff type. It does not require submitting the search
or reloading the page. Changing category loads that category's available items.
On mobile, `Voir commande` opens the current order summary over the item grid
without navigating away or reloading the page. Closing it preserves the current
category, search, and grid position.

Do not delete old menu items for historical correction. Toggle availability
instead.

## Local Combo Management

Combo management belongs to the local POS management UI and uses only the
local POS database. Open `Gestion locale > Combos` or go directly to
`/management/combos`. An active local administrator or manager session is
required.

Combos are payment discounts, not kitchen production rules.

Combo behavior:

```txt
Rules can define a fixed combo price
Rules can also define "plat + supplement" pricing
Groups define required choices
Eligible menu items can have extra price
Higher-priority rules are applied first
The same item quantity cannot be reused twice
```

For Luna-style formulas, use the `Plat + supplement` pricing mode:

```txt
Menu Express   = selected plat price + 4 EUR
Menu Gourmand  = selected plat price + 8 EUR
Combo Ete      = selected plat price + 2.50 EUR
```

At Luna, `Assortiment – Mix LUNA (11 pcs)` is sold at its standalone price and
is not eligible as the entry in Menu Express or Menu Gourmand.

The `Groupe base` field must match the combo group that contains the priced
main dish, usually `Plat`.

Create a rule in the inactive state, then add its groups and eligible menu
items. Group structure and eligible-item prices can be changed only while the
rule is inactive. Before activation, `site-agent` verifies that the rule has
at least one group, every required group has an eligible item, and a
`Plat + supplement` rule names an existing base group.

To change an active formula, deactivate it, edit the groups or eligible items,
then activate it again. Existing paid-order discount snapshots are preserved.

Rules are never physically deleted because paid orders may reference their
discount history. Deactivate a retired rule instead. Groups and eligible-item
mappings may be removed while their rule is inactive.

Combos are applied during payment optimization. Editing an inactive rule does
not rewrite discounts already persisted on paid orders.

## Local Operational Reports

Operational reports are generated locally from `db-pos`. They are not cloud
reports. The local reporting UI should show:

```txt
Paid revenue today
Paid orders today
Open orders
Today order list
```

Each order can be opened in POS from the report page.

## Local Print Queue

The print queue belongs to `site-agent` and the local management UI.
Open `Gestion locale > File d'impression` or go directly to
`/management/printing`. An active local administrator or manager session is
required to read or change the queue.

The local screen shows recent print jobs:

```txt
pending
printing
printed
failed
```

Print job types:

```txt
kitchen_ticket     created when staff sends items to production
customer_receipt   retained only for historical compatibility; not created
```

Manual actions:

```txt
Démarrer     pending -> printing
Imprimé      printing -> printed
Échec        pending/printing -> failed
Réessayer    failed -> pending
Réimprimer   printed -> pending
```

The failure reason remains visible until the job is retried. A completed row
offers `Réimprimer`, which requeues the same saved ticket snapshot. The screen also
shows the printer-name snapshot, source, linked order, creation time, and a
safe summary of the ticket payload. Raw print payloads are not exposed to the
browser.

The queue and printer status refresh automatically every five seconds while the page is visible,
and refreshes immediately when returning to its tab. Operators do not need to
reload the whole page to see pending, printing, printed, or failed transitions.

The `État de l’imprimante` card shows the RFCOMM channel, local worker, pending,
printing and failed queue counts, and the latest successful print. `Prête à
envoyer` means Linux can access the configured character device; it does not
confirm paper, cover, or cutter state. Use `Impression test` for that physical
check. The compact printer badge in the global status strip updates every 15
seconds while the POS tab is visible.

The top of the same page contains the persisted ticket settings:

```txt
Cuisine copies: 1 to 3
Full BAR ticket copies: 1 to 3
Text size: Compact, Standard, or Large
Top spacing: 0 to 8 lines
Left spacing: 0 to 8 characters
Bottom spacing: 0 to 8 lines
```

Settings apply to newly created jobs. Each job keeps its copy count, font
preset, and spacing snapshot, so retrying an older failed job does not silently
change its layout. Paper width remains fixed at 80 mm. The physical device path is trusted
site-agent configuration and cannot be edited in the browser.

Select `Impression test` after saving settings to enqueue one test job. It
prints a Cuisine sample followed by a full BAR sample. Both use the saved
layout settings, and the printer performs a full cut after each ticket. The
sample includes accented words, apostrophes, dashes, options, and allergy
emphasis. It does not create or modify a customer order.

## Physical Printer Adapter

When `POS_PRINTER_DEVICE` is configured, `site-agent` claims pending
`kitchen_ticket` jobs, renders an ASCII-safe ESC/POS ticket, writes it through
the bound Linux RFCOMM character device, and marks the job `printed` or
`failed`. A kitchen send creates a `CUISINE` ticket when the sent batch contains
kitchen items, plus an independent `BAR` ticket containing the complete sent
batch. The single TM-m30 prints and fully cuts them sequentially; station
`none` is excluded. Cuisine is grouped in the fixed order Entrées, Suppléments,
Plats. BAR is grouped Boissons, Entrées, Suppléments, Plats, then Desserts,
regardless of item insertion order. Every ticket and configured copy is written
separately. The adapter throttles long bodies in small chunks and closes the
body writer, waits one second, opens a fresh writer for only the feed/full-cut
trailer, then waits another 800 ms before the next ticket to stabilize the
Bluetooth cutter.
Raw payloads and the device path never reach the browser. The current Luna host
exposes the paired TM-m30 as `/dev/rfcomm1` through a systemd binding.

## Important Behavior Notes

### No VAT In This App

YuTa POS is internal and does not implement VAT or certified cash-register behavior. The restaurant uses separate certified cash-register software.

### No Hard Deletes For Operational History

For orders and items, prefer status changes instead of deletion:

```txt
cancel item
restore item
toggle menu availability
mark payment status
void replaced split checks
```

This keeps historical order data consistent.

When an unpaid split is replaced by another split mode, the old open checks are marked `void` instead of being deleted. Once any split check is paid, the split mode cannot be replaced.

### Menu Snapshots

Order items store:

```txt
item name snapshot
unit price snapshot
kitchen station snapshot
```

Changing the menu later does not change old order totals or kitchen history.

### Kitchen Ticket Batches

Each `Envoyer cuisine` action creates a kitchen ticket only for the items that were still `A envoyer` at the moment of that send. Adding more items later and sending again creates a new ticket for the new batch.

Kitchen tickets include the general order note and each printed item's
preparation note. An item allergy is printed immediately below that item as a
prominent `!!! ALLERGY ... !!!` line.

### Display App Is Separate

`apps/yuta-display` is separate from the POS operations ecosystem and has its own database setup.

The target POS runtime uses:

```txt
apps/yuta-pos
apps/site-agent
packages/db-pos
packages/contracts
packages/core
packages/ui
```

The cloud back-office does not manage POS users, menu/catalog, printers, orders,
payments, or operational reports. Those workflows belong to a local UI backed
by `site-agent`.

## Current MVP Limits

Known MVP constraints:

```txt
No table map
No staff login flow
No physical ESC/POS printer integration
No real fiscal receipt
Split by items client count is selected directly on the split-by-items screen
No partial kitchen status inside a single item row quantity
```

These are intentional MVP limits, not bugs.
