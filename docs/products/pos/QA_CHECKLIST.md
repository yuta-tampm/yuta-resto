# YuTa POS QA Checklist

Status: Current

Visibility: Local operator

Owner: YUTA engineering and QA

Last updated: 2026-08-08

Use this checklist to stabilize the POS MVP before adding larger features.

This checklist targets the post-reset local architecture. Cloud `apps/backoffice`
must not be used for POS staff, menu/catalog, combo, printer, order, payment,
or operational-report QA.

Run QA against the local apps:

```txt
POS:        http://localhost:3003
Site agent: configured local URL
```

Target local services:

```bash
docker compose --project-name yuta-pos-dev -f docker-compose.local.dev.yml up -d --wait
pnpm db:pos:migrate
pnpm db:pos:seed
pnpm dev:site-agent
pnpm --filter @yuta/pos dev
```

If a newly added route returns `404` in `next dev`, restart the affected dev
server before marking the case as failed. Turbopack can keep stale route state
after route files are added during development.

## Result Legend

```txt
PASS      works as expected
FAIL      broken or incorrect
BLOCKED   cannot test because another issue blocks it
N/A       not applicable for this run
```
